= Relationship Between Energy, Momentum, Wavelength

Momentum (p) to classical kinetic energy (E):

$ E = p^2/(2m) $

Energy to wavelength (De Broglie) @2021Schrodinger:

$ lambda = h/p $

= Spherical Harmonics

Due to a spherical shaped electrical force field, we cannot 
just use sine waves in 1D, but we need the 3D version,
spherical harmonics @2021Schrodinger. We see this when we compute 
quantum energy levels and states for the hydrogen atom 
@2022Hydrogen.

From spherical harmonics, we get three important quantum numbers.
$n$ is the principal quantum number representing energy levels.
$l$ is the quantum number representing angular momentum.
$m$ is the quantum number representing angular momentum projection
(or magnetic orbital quantum number) @2022Orbital.
